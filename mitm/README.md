## MITM 
- **sudo docker network ls** - gives us the bridge name for the docker network, which we can then use with tcpdump to listen to the traffic from the webapp to the database
- **sudo tcpdump -i br-0555bd9df806 -A -s 0 'port 3306'** - This is the command that actually listens to the traffic and outputs it to the terminal, the output from this command can be seen in mitmlogs.png
- We were able to clearly see the information sent from the database to the webapp which demonstrates how important it is to encrypt traffic.
- Using this flag we can then capture flag 3 by using it as an authentication token to access a hidden service that we discovered on port 8888 using the port scanner. 
- **http://172.20.0.21:8888/flag?token=FLAG{n3tw0rk_tr4ff1c_1s_n0t_s3cur3}**
